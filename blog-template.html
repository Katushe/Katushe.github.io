 How was it to wireframe and create an HTML page with a pair?

    My pair was more experienced in wireframing/HTML than I am, so it was helpful to me to have his input. We had similar ideas as to what we want out blog posts to look like, so it was easy to work together.

 Did you find wireframing to be helpful to your development process?

    I am a visual person, so making a wireframe/planning out the layout is helpful to me. This was I can visualize how I want the website to look before I start actually building it, and have something to reference later.

 What did you and your pair decide made a good wireframe?

    We agreed that good wireframes are very simple/barebones. The primary purpose is just to decide where everything will be on the page, without getting too distracted by more minor details.

 What new semantic elements did you learn about (if any)?

    While reading about the various semantic elements, I saw that the article element is used for independent, self-contained content and that it is commonly used for blog posts, hence why we used it here. While working on this challenge I learned a bit more about it, like the fact that it can have its own header/footer.
