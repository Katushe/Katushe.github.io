**What did you learn about CSS padding, borders, and margin by doing this challenge?**

 Working with the chrome devtools was very helpful for this-the way it highlights the margin/padding in different colors when you hover over an element made it much easier to visualize what was happening. I understand that margins are used between elements and padding on content within an element, however, it seemed like changing the padding and margin had similar effects on spacing a lot of the times so I'm still a little iffy on whether there's much difference between the two.

**What did you learn about CSS positioning?**

Working on my website helped me understand absolute positioning better in terms of how it relates to the parentage of the element. For instance, everything would start out at the top left of the page, and then once I started changing the positioning of some of the elements, their child elements would end up at the top left of where they were, and then the children's top/right/left/bottom positioning was based off that starting point instead of the top left of the whole page.

**What aspects of your design did you find easiest to implement? What was most difficult?**

Setting up the colors/fonts/icons/pictures was the easiest Getting all the positioning right was the most dificult, but using the devtools definitely helped a lot and made it much faster than editing and reediting my files.

**What did you learn about adding and formatting elements with CSS in this challenge?**

I learned more about inheritance. I had some trouble with wanting the same type of element to show up slightly differently without affecting others, and without me having to repeat code, especially when using multiple css files. Once again, the devtools were helpful since it spells out what properties are inherited/which ones have been overridden by newer rules.
